- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m ColynFarley
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computers, cars, horses, and hunting.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything to do with cyber security so that I can obtain my degree.
I spend four years in the Marines before leaving and deciding to persue my degree. It has been an interesting adjustment to say the least.
